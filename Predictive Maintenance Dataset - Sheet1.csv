Feature Name,Description
UID,"Unique identifier for each operation, ranging from 1 to 10,000."
Product ID,"Product identifier indicating quality: ""L"" (Low), ""M"" (Medium), and ""H"" (High)."
Type,"Product quality type (""L"", ""M"", or ""H"")."
Air Temperature [K],Ambient temperature around the machine; centered around 300 K with a standard deviation of 2 K.
Process Temperature [K],"Temperature during the machine operation, centered around 310 K (air temperature + 10 K)."
Rotational Speed [rpm],"Speed of the machine tool in revolutions per minute, derived from a 2860 W power base with noise."
Torque [Nm],"Applied force during the operation, normally distributed around 40 Nm with a standard deviation of 10."
Tool Wear [min],"Amount of wear on the tool during operation, incremented based on product quality."
Machine Failure,Class label (0 or 1) indicating if a failure occurred.
TWF,"Tool Wear Failure (1 if true, 0 otherwise), occurs randomly between 200â€“240 mins."
HDF,"Heat Dissipation Failure (1 if true, 0 otherwise), based on temperature difference and speed."
PWF,"Power Failure (1 if true, 0 otherwise), occurs if operational power deviates beyond set limits."
OSF,"Overstrain Failure (1 if true, 0 otherwise), due to torque and tool wear exceeding quality thresholds."
RNF,"Random Failure, with a 0.1% chance of occurrence independently of other parameters."
